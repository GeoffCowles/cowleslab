This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses some [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and  [Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com). It is adapted from the template of the Allan Lab at Leiden (https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab).  We adjusted some formatting and added a few additional content listings. 

To start from the Allan Lab template, follow instructions from their "about" file at: https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab/blob/gh-pages/_pages/aboutwebsite.md
