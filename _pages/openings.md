# Open positions

Our students work on a range of problems from large scale (coastal ocean) to small scale (larval fish) and from biology-aligned to tradiational engineering applications.  It is critical you have an interest in computing and some experience writing code.  The software we work with is open source and most projects require getting your hands dirty in the code. We welcome tenacious students who are dedicated to discovery.  

#### UMass Intercampus Marine Science Program MS/PhD 
Our graduate program is the <a href="http://www.umassmarine.net/" target="_blank">Intercampus Marine Science program</a>which includes both PhD and MS degree tracks. If you interested in the program, we encourage you to apply for admission. If you are additionally interested in working with us, please send me an [email](mailto:gcowles@umassd.edu) and state your interest and background and attach a CV. 

#### UMass Dartmouth MNE M.S. and EAS Ph.D. students
If you are in one of the two M.S. degree tracks in Mechanical Engineering (MNE) or in the Engineering and Applied Sciences (EAS) PhD track at UMass Dartmouth and seeking a thesis project, contact me to discuss.  I am affiliated with MNE and have advised students in these tracks.  

#### Support 
Students in my lab are supported through a mix of self-funding, TA-ships, and competitive external funds.  Presently I do not have any external funding available to support students.
